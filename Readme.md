Web app developed with Mongodb, node.js and express.js. Users can create an account,
or sign up with google using OAuth2.0, Type in their secret and their secrets will authenticate
be anonymously displayed on a mass secrets page. (kinda like the whisper app) Tried implementing
Facebook OAuth too but the new facebook login API does not support running on localhost any longer.
